# @yusufceng1z/ding-react

Toasts with real spring physics for React 18+. One toast that morphs in place. No stylesheet to import.

## Install

```bash
npm i @yusufceng1z/ding-react
```

## Use

Render the toaster once, then call `toast` from anywhere.

```tsx
import { Toaster, toast } from '@yusufceng1z/ding-react';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Toaster position="top-center" theme="system" />
      <button onClick={() => toast.success('Saved')}>Save</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Works in the Next.js App Router as is: the package ships `"use client"`, so `Toaster` can go straight into `app/layout.tsx`. See the [Next.js guide](https://ding.yusufcengiz.dev/nextjs-toast/).

Right-to-left pages mirror automatically. `<Toaster dir="rtl" />` sets the direction yourself, and the `top-start`, `top-end`, `bottom-start` and `bottom-end` positions follow it.

Options, actions, progress, sound and accessibility are covered in the [docs](https://ding.yusufcengiz.dev/docs.html).
